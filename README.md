RealTimeBusTracker
======
#### Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise:

**Description:** In this exercise we are tracking buses in the Massachusetts Bay area using data from the free API available from [mbta.com](mbta.com). The map and markers are rendered using MapBoxGL library and API services from (mapbox.com)[mapbox.com].

**Usage:** Download the code repository to your computer and get an API key by registering for an account with (MapBox)[mapbox.com]. Update the `mapanimation.js` file with the MapBox API key in line 4. 

**Roadmap:** For now the next steps is to replace the mapping with Google maps or other mapping services and also add filters to select individual busses to track.
